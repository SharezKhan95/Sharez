    <h1>My Friends</h1>
    <p>I have a lot of friends who complete me. I have a best friend too.<br>
    My friends also help me do everyday things. I help them a well. <br>
  Somethings we do together are hang out, play video games, do homeowrk together, and even do sports.<br>
I am grateful for my friends, they make me laugh, have fun, and sometimes prank me too. <br>
<br>
<br> Some people ask what really is a friends?<br>
I would describe it like this: A friend is someone who helps you, stays by your side <br>
and can give up something for you. A friend will make you laugh and hate them sometimes too.<br>
A friend will always be with you!</p>
